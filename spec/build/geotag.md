# Geotag — how this build does it

How this build meets [geotag's intent](../intent/geotag.md) and the shared contract's geotag rules: the files, names,
tools and steps. Each item `realises` the intent it implements. *Why* a choice was made is in
[the rationale](../rationale/geotag.md).

## 2. Core workflow rule

:::{bld} Geotag's planning stages, in order
:id: BLD-geotag_stage_order
:status: ruled
:realises: RUL-time_before_gps

`geotag plan` SHALL write `photos-21-time-decisions.json`; only once it is complete resolve each photo's true time and
write `photos-22-gps-drift-validation.json`; only once that is complete write `photos-23-gps-decisions.json`; and only
once all three are complete assemble `photos-24-executable-plan.json`, which refuses any photo without a valid
resolved time.

:::{bld} Geotag's preflight refuses a photo with no recorded time
:id: BLD-geotag_untimed_gate
:status: ruled
:realises: RUL-untimed_photo_stops_geotag

Geotag's preflight for `plan` SHALL block on every handoff record of a photo under `6-photos-by-dest` whose
`metadata_status.has_timestamp` — or, failing it, the `has_timestamp` of its `parsed_json` — is false, naming the
photos and `2-missing-metadata`.
