# Prep — how this build does it

How this build meets [prep's intent](../intent/prep.md): the files, names, tools and steps. Each item `realises` the
intent it implements. *Why* a choice was made is in [the rationale](../rationale/prep.md).

## 2. What prep does, and what it leaves alone

:::{bld} Prep's operations hold no metadata write
:id: BLD-prep_operation_kinds
:status: ruled
:realises: RUL-prep_no_time_or_gps

Prep's execute SHALL carry out only folder creations, moves, renames, quarantine moves and database writes, refusing a
plan that holds any other operation — a metadata write among them.
:::

:::{bld} No operation touches `6-photos-by-dest`
:id: BLD-by_dest_ops_refused
:status: ruled
:realises: RUL-prep_leaves_by_dest_as_found

Prep's plan SHALL hold no operation whose source or destination lies in `6-photos-by-dest`, its execute refusing a plan
that holds one; prep reads the files there for their fingerprint and metadata only (prep §10, §11).
