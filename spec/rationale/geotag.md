# Geotag — why

**Not normative.** Each item here is the reasoning behind the [intent](../intent/geotag.md) or [build](../build/geotag.md)
items it `justifies`, under the same section numbers. Where the two differ, the intent wins and this is stale.
Sections are numbered as in the phase's original spec; a section whose content lives in the shared contract, or
that only restated others, has no heading here.

## 2. Core workflow rule

:::{rat} A position is looked up by time
:id: RAT-position_follows_time
:status: ruled
:justifies: RUL-time_before_gps

A photo with no position of its own is placed where the track was at the moment it was taken — its true time, after
the camera's clock is corrected. Placed before that time is settled, it would be placed at the wrong moment of the
track, possibly kilometres off, and every position would have to be planned again once the time changed. So the time
is settled for every photo first, and only then is any position planned.
:::

:::{rat} No phase invents a time
:id: RAT-no_phase_invents_time
:status: ruled
:justifies: RUL-untimed_photo_stops_geotag

A photo with no recorded time has nothing to correct and nothing to look up: its true time is unknown, and no
camera's offset or destination's timezone can supply one. Prep sets such a photo aside in missing metadata for the
user to deal with by hand. Sorted into a destination anyway, it would pass through geotag's decisions with nothing to
ask about it and stop only at the last plan, where nothing the user could decide would clear it. Stopping at the start,
naming it and where it belongs, makes the one possible fix plain.

## 5. Linear dependency inclusion

:::{rat} A chain is only as fresh as its weakest link
:id: RAT-no_chain_of_vouching
:status: ruled
:justifies: RUL-geotag_plan_carries_every_dependency

The decision records are files the user edits between runs, in the editor or by hand. If the plan named only the last
of them and trusted it to name the rest, a change upstream of it — a track added, an earlier record edited after the
later one was written — would pass unseen whenever the later record happened not to be rewritten. Carried in the plan
itself, every input is checked against what it is now, at the one moment that matters: just before anything changes.

## 7. Geotag scope

:::{rat} Only what the user sorted is ready
:id: RAT-only_sorted_is_ready
:status: seed
:justifies: RUL-geotag_changes_only_by_dest

A photo's destination is what geotag corrects it by: the timezone of the place, the offset of that camera on that
day, the fallback position of the folder. A photo not yet sorted has none of these, and a file in the other folders is
not a photo to place — a stray, one missing metadata, a JPEG set aside beside its RAW. Videos stay where prep put them:
the pipeline does not place them, and a tag written into one would be a guess. Sorting a photo into a destination is
the user's statement that it is ready.
